# BandSite - Sprint I

# Project Overview

This week, you will start a project for an up-and-coming band. The project will be broken into 3 parts (sprints of 1 week each). You will be required to build a website, and all required functionality over the next 3 weeks. Each week has a required deliverable. Creative mock ups and design specs will be provided, and your task is to use the mock ups and requirements to create a fully functional live site for the band.

For this sprint, you will be focused on building a responsive, web-site based on the provided mock ups and design specs.

# Tools & Resources

* Make use of a design package (assets, style guide, spec sheet, and creative mockup) to create a functional and responsive site.
  * Download the complete design package here.
* You will need to find some royalty free music-related assets. Unsplash is a popular resource for royalty-free images.
* VSCode’s Live SASS Compiler will transform SASS to CSS on the fly. You will need to install the extension into VSCode and click “Watch SASS…” at the bottom of your screen for live SASS compiling.

# Functional Requirements

* Return Home Link: Located in the top-left corner of the nav is the word / logo "BANDSITE". Clicking on this should return visitors to the home page.

# Visual Design Requirements
* The site must closely resemble the mockups and design specs provided in the design package.
* The site must be responsive at all dimensions, including between the provided break-points.
* You must use royalty-free images for the Album Hero Image and the Band Members Image sourced online.
* You must use the assets provided for your photo gallery.

# Implementation Requirements
* Your project must follow the proper folder structure and naming conventions outlined in the project guidelines
* You must use SASS for your styling, and take advantage of SASS variables, plus any other SASS features that can help improve your code.
* Class naming for your styling must use BEM
* Layout of the site must use Flexbox
* Follow component based design and identify common blocks of code which you can reuse your styles for.
